NAME
	xkey

DESCRIPTION
	Sits in the background grabbing keys in X and running the
	associated shell command.

CONFIGURATION
	This program is configured by editing the config.h file and then
	recompiling in suckless (https://suckless.org/) fashion.

RATIONALE
	The program xbindkeys is bloated (Guile? really?), and handles things
	no one needs/uses.
	This alternative aims to be tiny and to the point.
